When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When collaborating with other users it's easier to share updates by using a remote 
  repository. This way others can contribute, and get changes too.
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  Changes can cause conflicts. If you are in the process of creating a new feature, you 
  don't want to solve those conflicts but finish your feature first.
  This way you can keep focus and decide when you want to get the latest versions and 
  integrate changes.
  
Commands:
  
git remote  |    Show all remote locations for the repository
git remote -v |  Show urls of remote locations
git remote add origin url |   Add a new remote location for the repository. Origin is 
                              the default name to use when you create only one remote 
                              location. Url should be the https url to the github
                              repository.
git push origin master | Push new commits in master branch to origin remote
git pull origin master  |    Get the master branch from the remote location origin.
