When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  When collaborating with other users it's easier to share updates by using a remote repository. This way others can contribute, and get changes too.
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  Because i may currently work on a branch and i don't want it to be updated somehow. This situation can occur if some one have changed that branch on remote.
  
Commands:
  
git remote  |    Show all remote locations for the repository
git remote -v |  Show urls of remote locations
git push origin master | Push new commits in master branch to origin remote
