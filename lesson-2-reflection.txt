What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
  
  + folder .git with git metadata is created, including data
    about new empty repository.
  + It is needed to start tracking commits, that is state
    changing of the folder and it's files and subfolders.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

  + After initing new repository, there aren't any files in
    it yet. however they may be present in working
    directory.
  + Staging area allows you to decide what exactly files 
    should be put into commit, thus into repository. So
    you first add files to staging area one by one.
  + Then you add everything in staging area to commit.
